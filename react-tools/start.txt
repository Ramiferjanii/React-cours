If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app,
we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app
 or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.



 Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
 When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.


 Get Started Immediately
You don’t need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you’re good to go.
